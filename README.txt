Introduction

The deoxybyte-utilities system provides general purpose
utilities. These are for the most part simple, standalone functions
and macros. Once a particular function or macro has been written more
than once or twice in other systems, it normally gets moved here.

Given the fluid nature of the contents of this system, its packages'
exported symbols are intended primarily for use by other deoxybyte
packages.


Documentation

See the Lisp docstrings, particularly the package docstrings for an
